# XIO-Clapping-Game

This is a fun game created by Wuluo Road Middle School in Wuhan, China.

And it is extremely popular in Wuhan Foreign Languages School, China.

In Class 5, 6 and 8 in Grade 2019, nearly everyone is able to play it.

Because of the busy study in Grade 9, students in those classes can hardly play this game, and they had no time to spread it to younger students. What's worse, Many of the older students had already forgotten the rules.

So ```OrientalHorizon``` as well as ```Clever_Jimmy```, created this Github project in order to let people know about the game and its complicated but fun rules, and then, revive this fantastic game.

-------------------------

In this project, there are temporarily just texts, introducing the aim and rules of this game. Later, we will put on a problem which requires imitation of this game using C++, created by ```Clever_Jimmy```. Once the contest held by ```A hit of 999``` is over, we will also put on the source code of this imitation.

*\* ```A hit of 999``` is a team led by ```Clever_Jimmy``` ```OrientalHorizon``` etc.*

We hope you can enjoy this fantastic game, and spread it to your friends ~~as well as parents~~!!!
